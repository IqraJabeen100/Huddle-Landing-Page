## Overview
This project is a responsive landing page built for the **Huddle landing page with a single introductory section** challenge on Frontend Mentor.  
The goal was to recreate the provided design as closely as possible using **HTML and CSS**.  

The page includes:
- A two-column layout on desktop (illustration + text with call-to-action)
- A stacked layout on mobile
- Responsive background images
- Hover states for the button and social icons  

This challenge helped me practice **Flexbox layouts, responsive design, and accessibility improvements**.



### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a responsive landing page based on the provided design.  

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size (desktop and mobile)
- See hover states for all interactive elements (the register button and social media icons)

## My process

### 1. Project setup
- Created the project folder and initialized a GitHub repository
- Added starter files (HTML, CSS, images)

### 2. HTML structure
- Wrote semantic HTML with `header`, `main`, and `footer`
- Used descriptive `alt` attributes for images

### 3. CSS base styles
- Added a CSS reset (`* { margin: 0; padding: 0; box-sizing: border-box; }`)
- Defined root color variables (`--purple`, `--pink`, `--white`)
- Set up typography (headings with Poppins, paragraphs with Open Sans)

### 4. Layout
- Used Flexbox for a two-column layout (illustration left, content right)
- Limited text width for readability
- Added spacing with `gap` and `padding`

### 5. Interactivity
- Styled the **Register** button with box-shadow and hover states
- Added hover states for social icons (color + border change)
- Included focus-visible styles for keyboard users

### 6. Responsiveness
- Used media queries at `375px` for mobile layout
- Stacked columns vertically and centered content
- Switched from `bg-desktop.svg` to `bg-mobile.svg` background image

### 7. Final touches
- Added README with screenshot, live demo, and learnings
- Deployed project on GitHub Pages

### What I learned

-CSS Flexbox 
-Two Column Layout

### Continued development

-Flexbox
-Perfect alignment
-Best image sizes
